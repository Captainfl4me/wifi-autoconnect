## How to create config file
First, create a config.ini file in the same directory as the script. Then, open the file and write the following:
```ini
[YOUR_SUBCONFIG_NAME]
SSID = YOUR_SSID
URL = YOUR_URL
METHOD = POST
USERNAME = YOUR_USERNAME
PASSWORD = YOUR_PASSWORD
```
You can add as many sub-configs as you want, just make sure to choose a different name for each section. 
For example, if you want to add a second subconfig, you can name it [YOUR_SUBCONFIG_NAME2].
